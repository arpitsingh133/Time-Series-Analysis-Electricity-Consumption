# Time-Series-Analysis-Electricity-Consumption
## Aim: Forecasting next month’s hourly electric consumption using advanced time series models based on historical data from DMI.
- Executed comprehensive EDA, handled missing values using LOCF, performed additive decomposition to separately identify and
 analyze Trend, Seasonality, and Irregular components and applied Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to check Stationarity.
– Forecasted next month’s hourly electric consumption using advanced models like ARIMA, SARIMA, ARIMAX and SARIMAX.
– Result: Achieved the lowest RMSE with SARIMAX and ARIMAX, demonstrating their superiority as the best forecasting models.
